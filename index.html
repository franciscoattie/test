				This year, Cristiano Ronaldo became the player with most goals in soccer history. According to some at least. With 801 career goals, the Portuguese still has a long way to go before he hangs up his boots, and going as far as the 1000 goal mark doesn’t seem unrealistic at this point. For now though, celebrating his return to the English Premier League, and his continued reign atop the UEFA Champions League, here are a couple of maps showing the opponents that have conceded the most against Ronaldo:

				Ronaldo scores the most against Manchester United’s closest (distanced) rivals

				</div>
			</p>

			<p>
				Ronaldo’s highest concentration of goals comes against teams from the North West region of England, where Manchester United are located. In the Premier league, Ronaldo has scored against 24 clubs. 6 of which are in the North West: Bolton Wanderers (6), Wigan Athletic (6), Everton (4), Blackburn Rovers (3), Manchester City (3) and Liverpool (2).
			</p>

			<p>
				The second-closest region is London, where he scored 22 goals against 5 opponents. One could argue that he has more goals against opponents that sit closer to Man United because there were more opponents to face there, but that’s exactly not true, Ronaldo has never scored in the EPL against Chelsea or Crystal Palace both London teams. So, if we were to make a hypothesis, it could be that the rivalries call louder to him when they are closer to home. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The team Ronaldo has scored the most goals against in the EPL is Aston Villa, with 8. Fulham and Newcastle are a close second with 7 each. In total, he has scored 87 goals in the British top flight. 
			</p>

			<h3>
				Despite having scored the most goals against Juventus, Ronaldo seems to find it easier, in general, to score against German teams
			</h3>

			</p>

			<p>
				As of Nov. 23, 2021, Ronaldo has scored 140 goals in the Champions League, the most by any player ever. To get to the 143 tally here, he adds another 3 goals from other UEFA competitions such as the the Super Cup. With 10 goals, Juventus are the opponents against which he’s scored the most, which he accomplished in just 7 games. Ajax and Bayern München are close seconds with 9 each.
			</p>		

			<p>
				German teams, in general, seem to be Ronaldo’s favorite opponents in the UCL, as he has scored an impressive 28 goals in 25 games against 5 teams: Bayern (9), Borussia Dortmund (7), Schalke 04 (7), Wolfsburg (3) and Bayer 04 Leverkusen (2). With German teams having a reputation of being hard to breakdown defensively, it is an impressive tally.
			</p>

			<p>
				In total so far, Ronaldo has scored against 40 opponents from 16 countries in the UCL. It has led him to 5 Champions League trophies, and with a few years left before his certain decline due to age, it wouldn’t be surprising if he ended up with another trophy. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Though I’m one of those who counts Pelé’s (1283) and Romário’s (1002) full goal tally, it is undeniable that Ronaldo has reached the pinnacle of the sport. Seemingly ageless, Ronaldo has played at the top level of European football for almost 20 years now and shows no signs of stopping. And while Manchester United might not be a powerhouse of a team this season to bring Ronaldo some more trophies, he has certainly been happy so far to just add to his goal scoring record.
