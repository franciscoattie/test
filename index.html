				Historically, soccer has been a direct and powerful influence on the mood of the Brazilian population. Specifically, the performance of the national team in the World Cup has swung feelings towards regimes. What follows is a brief historical investigation: 
			</p>

			<p>
				Brazil had a military dictatorship that lasted from 1964 to 1985. Much has been written about how Brazil’s World Cup win in 1970 was sought after by the regime in order to increase support from the population. The period from 1968-74 was the most brutal in the dictatorship. With the signing of the “Ato Institucional Número Cinco,” Institutional Act Number 5 (AI-5), many civil liberties were stripped from the population, and opposers to the regime were systematically imprisoned, tortured and killed.

			<p>
				General Emílio Garrastazu Médici, president of Brazil from 1969-74, was intent in vinculating a successful World Cup campaign with his office. The regime’s direct influence on the team went as far as the sacking of the head coach, João Saldanha, mere months before the World Cup, because, among other things, he was a member of the, then illegal, Communist Party (PCB), and he refused to use the players that were personally selected by General Médici.
			</p>

			<p> 
				After the team won the World Cup and returned to Brazil, the players went on a parade in the capital, Brasília. Though this isn’t uncommon, the most marked pictures of the parade, however, included Médici lifting the World Cup trophy. Later declarations of players like Pelé and Tostão show clear discomfort in having been used in the regime’s publicity scheme, which contributed to an added feeling of optimism in Brazil.
			</p>
			
			<p> 
				The national team never ceased to be used for political capital. And poor campaigns in the World Cup have also influenced on the downfall of governments. After the disastrous campaign of 2014, a real disconnect could be felt between the population and then President Dilma Rousseff. Though she achieved reelection at the end of 2014, she would be impeached only a year later and was removed from office in 2016. Of course the WC performance wasn’t a direct influence on Dilma’s impeachment, but the rhetoric associated to the opposition was mired in much of the same anger, frustration and humiliation experienced the year before.

			<p> 
				It is important to note that Brazil was the host nation for the World Cup in 2014, and certainly not because of the country’s infrastructure. FIFA is a highly political body. Though they claim to be safeguards for soccer, the sheer volume of corruption scandals to have emerged from the organization points to their motivation laying elsewhere. When Brazil won the bid to host the tournament, and with Russia and Qatar being selected as the next hosts, much was debated on whether the three countries standing as some of the biggest oil producers in the world had anything to do with it. Though Brazil cold be seen as a consciable choice given its soccer history, Russia and Qatar certainly cannot. Either way, much of the corruption scandal associated with Dilma’s party, the Worker’s Party (PT), which contributed heavily to the public opinion concerning the President, has to do with Brazil’s biggest oil company, Petrobrás.
			</p>
			
			<p> 
				Finally, it must be said that, during President Bolsonaro’s campaign and government so far, he and his supporters have made a conscious push to vinculate the national team and its iconography to Bolsonaro’s image. For example, one cannot wear the national team’s famous yellow jersey in Brazil right now without being confused for a supporter of the president. During the campaign, in Bolsonaro’s rallies, his supporter were encouraged to wear the yellow jersey, associating it to claims of true Brazilianhood mired in a rhetoric directly related to Trump’s in the US.

			<p> 
				The National Soccer Confederation (CBF), claims not to be a political organization; its leaders, many of whom have been arrested on corruption charges, always avoid public displays of support for the government. Their silence, however, is most notable, especially when the team’s iconography and status are being used so blatantly by the president. 
			</p>
			

			<p> 
				During one of the toughest periods of the pandemic for Brazil, the national team was supposed to participate in the Copa América, which would occur simultaneously with the Euros. The 2020 edition of the tournament was supposed to take place in Argentina, but the hosts pulled out because of the large COVID-19 infection and death numbers in the country. Bolsonaro and the CBF stepped in, and offered Brazil as hosts. The CONMENBOL, FIFA’s sister organization in Latin America, happily accepted Brazil’s bid, even though the country was facing much greater problems in containing the pandemic than Argentina.

									<td> Support for the tournamnet </td>
									<td> 35% </td>
								</tr>

			<p> 
				Brazil were seen as heavy favorites to win the tournament, and the country’s political unrest at the time, was certainly a contributing factor for Bolsonaro to so promptly throw the country’s name in the hat. Though the Copa America doesn’t have the glamour of the World Cup, it still adds to (or subtracts from) the national mood. When Brazil won the previous edition of the tournament in 2019, which was also hosted in Brazil, Bolsonaro appeared in the most notable celebration pictures with the players, cementing his iconography with the national team’s. His hope, was to do the same in 2021. Brazil lost in the final to Argentina.
			</p>

			<p> 
				Now, as we wait on the 2022 World Cup, Bolsonaro’s position is incredibly tenuous. After his disastrous handling of the pandemic, and a failed coup attempt on the 7th of September—two days after a rematch of the Copa America final was cancelled by Brazilian health authorities after it was discovered that some Argentinian players entered the country illegally while the CBF attempted to get their presence in Brazil validated with the government—Bolsonaro’s support is dwindling. But, for the first time since country’s re-democratization, the World Cup won’t happen before the presidential elections. Usually held in June, the WC will happen in December 2022 because the unsuitable temperatures of Qatari summers; Bolsonaro won’t be able to garner much support from a successful campaign as he seeks his re-election.
